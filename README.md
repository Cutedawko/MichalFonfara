Hi, thanks for being interested in my work!

I am a high school student creating some stuff like wallpapers and (currently one) texture pack for minecraft bedrock edition.
I am working my hardest to make all my work look the best it can and I am open to all criticism and suggestions. Everything I 
make is free and feel free to share it, but you must always credit me. I make all my wallpapers in GIMP.
You can modify all of my work, but remember to credit me.
Texturepacks are installed simply by double-clicking the .mcpack file after downloading it (this texturepack works only for 
the RTX beta of Windows 10 edition, but will also work for regular windows 10 edition, but you won't get the cool efects RTX 
provides).
I started my texturepack based on u/thecivilhulk's RTX vanilla conversion pack, but I am working towards making a full 
texture replacement. I am working on my pack using TextureEdit created by u/Warm_Teeth, which you can try out for yourself here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TextureEdit/. Also check out TheCivilHulk here: https://www.reddit.com/user/TheCivilHulk and here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKFlKaeuxgc1Tj3qurW_aVA, he taught me how to use TextureEdit with his video tutorials.
Lastly, if you really like my work, you can send me money thru PayPal: https://www.paypal.me/MichalFonfara, but it's not required,
my texturepack and wallpapers will always be free on this website.
Thanks for reading thru to the end, enjoy!
